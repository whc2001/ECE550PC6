# ECE 550 Project Checkpoint 3

Haochen Wang (hw362)

## Introduction

This checkpoint implements a 32-bit, 32-word register file using DFFEs. The register file comes with one data input (write) port and two individually addressed data output (read) ports. The first register ($0) will always read 0 and writing will be ignored.

## Modules

### dffe.v

This is the provided DFFE reference design that is implemented with behavioral Verilog. No changes are made to this module.

### reg_32bit.v

This is a single 32-bit register file that uses 32 instances of the DFFE module. The `d` and `q` are 32-bit instead of 1-bit. Generative for loop is used to instantiate 32 DFFEs.

### allbit_and_5bit.v

This is the bitwise reducing AND that takes in a 5-bit input `in` and reducing into a 1-bit `out` that is AND'ing all bits in the input by using primitive AND gates. It's used to implement the address decoder for the register file.

### onehot_decoder_32bit.v

This is the decoder that takes in a 5-bit input `in` and outputs a 32-bit one-hot signal `out` that the only wire of HIGH level corresponds to the binary value of the input. It's implemented by ultilizing the behavioural bitwise operators which is explicitly allowed in the rubric. Generative for loop is used. The input is XOR'ed with loop index. When they match, the result will be all zero, which is then inverted to be all one, followed by AND'ing each bit, producing a HIGH on the corresponding output bit of the same index.

### regfile.v

This is the top-level register file module with the provided module signature. Forementioned modules are made use of. Ternary operator is used as tri-state buffer to control the output of the register file as in the example provided in the rubric. Only 31 DFFEs are generated by generative for loop, and the first address is hardwired to LOW to always read 0.
